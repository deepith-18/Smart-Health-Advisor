# Smart Health Advisor ü©∫

A friendly, AI-powered chatbot built with Streamlit and Google Gemini to provide preliminary health guidance based on user-described symptoms.


*(This is a placeholder image. You can replace this with a real screenshot or GIF of your running application.)*

## Overview

This project is an interactive web application that acts as a personal health chatbot. Users can describe their symptoms in plain English, and the application leverages the power of Google's Gemini Pro model to provide a structured and helpful response. The AI's response is always formatted into three clear sections: **Probable Conditions**, **Recommended Actions**, and **Dietary Suggestions**.

This application serves as an excellent educational tool for students and developers interested in:
-   Building AI-powered applications.
-   Using Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google Gemini.
-   Creating interactive web UIs with Streamlit.
-   Structuring a modern Python project.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer:** This tool is for informational and educational purposes only. It is **not** a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for any health concerns.

## Features

-   **Interactive Chat Interface:** A user-friendly chat layout built with Streamlit.
-   **AI-Powered Analysis:** Uses the Google Gemini API to understand natural language symptoms.
-   **Structured Responses:** Provides clear, organized advice in three distinct, tabbed sections.
-   **Text-to-Speech:** Includes an audio player to listen to the AI's response.
-   **Multi-Page Structure:** A clean, organized application with separate pages for the chat, home, and about sections.
-   **Self-Contained & Reliable:** Includes a local animation file, so it does not depend on external services to render the UI.

## Technology Stack

-   **Framework:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
-   **AI Engine:** [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/)
-   **Language:** Python 3.9+
-   **Key Libraries:** `google-generativeai`, `gtts`, `requests`, `python-dotenv`.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   **Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.9 or newer installed.
-   **Git:** Required for cloning the repository.
-   **Google Gemini API Key:** You need an API key to use the AI model.
    1.  Go to the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    2.  Click **"Create API key"** and copy the generated key.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepith-18/Smart-Health-Advisor.git
cd Smart-Health-Advisor

Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's a best practice to create an isolated environment for your project's dependencies.

On macOS/Linux:

Generated bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

On Windows:

Generated bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Your terminal prompt should now be prefixed with (venv).

Step 3: Create the .env File for Your API Key

This file will securely store your secret API key.

In the main project folder (Smart-Health-Advisor), create a new file named .env.

Open the .env file and add the following line, replacing "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with the key you got from Google AI Studio.

Generated code
# .env
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

The project is already configured with a .gitignore file, so this secret key will not be accidentally committed to Git.

Step 4: Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file.

Generated bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Step 5: Run the Streamlit Application

You are now ready to run the app!

Generated bash
streamlit run app.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Your web browser should automatically open a new tab with the Smart Health Advisor running. If it doesn't, the terminal will provide a local URL (usually http://localhost:8501) that you can open manually.

Project Structure

The project is organized into a standard multi-page Streamlit app structure for clarity and maintainability.
